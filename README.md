Quick program to remind you to take breaks throughout the day (e.g., to meditate or stretch)

Dependencies:
-Python 3  
-'time' package  
-'playsound' package  
-'datetime' package  

To use:
1. Download 'meditationTimer.py' and the 2 gong .wav files to your computer. Be sure to save them in the same folder. 

2. Run 'meditationTimer.py' in an IDE (e.g., Spyder) or via the Terminal (navigate to the location where you saved the files, then type "python meditationTimer.py"). The program will prompt you to enter some information, which should be self-explanatory.
